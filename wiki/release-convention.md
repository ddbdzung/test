## Conventional Commits

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification enforced by **Commitlint**.

**Format**

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>          # optional, blank line before
<footer>        # optional, blank line before
```

**Allowed Types**

| type     | when to use                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| feat     | A new feature                                           |
| fix      | A bug fix                                               |
| perf     | A performance improvement                               |
| refactor | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| docs     | Documentation only changes                              |
| style    | Formatting, white-space, missing semi-colons‚Ä¶           |
| test     | Adding or correcting tests                              |
| chore    | Maintenance tasks (build, tooling, deps)                |

**Allowed Scopes**

`core`, `modules`, `config`, `deps`, `docs`, `ci`, `dx`

> Tip: keep the subject imperative and under 72 characters.

```
feat(core): add pagination to user service

## Automated Releases with `pnpm release`

We delegate releases to [`standard-version`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) via the convenience script:

```jsonc
"scripts": {
  "release": "standard-version"
}
```

Running `pnpm release` will:

1. Read the commit history since the last tag.
2. Decide the next **semver** bump (`major` / `minor` / `patch`).
3. Update `version` in `package.json`.
4. Append a new section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. Commit with message `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` and tag `vX.Y.Z`.

### Typical Flow

```bash
# make sure your branch is up-to-date
git pull --rebase origin master

# verify tests & linters
pnpm test

# preview the release (no files touched)
pnpm release -- --dry-run

# perform the real release
pnpm release

# push commit and tag
git push --follow-tags origin master
```

### `.versionrc` configuration (standard-version)

`standard-version` is driven by the **.versionrc** file at the repository root. The file keeps all release-strategy decisions in version control, making behaviour explicit and reproducible.

Key excerpts:

```jsonc
{
  "releaseCommitMessageFormat": "chore(release): v{{currentTag}}", // Commit message for the bump commit
  "tagPrefix": "v", // Tag prefix, e.g. v1.2.3
  "types": [
    // Map commit types ‚Üí changelog sections
    { "type": "feat", "section": "‚ú® Features" },
    { "type": "fix", "section": "üêõ Bug Fixes" },
    { "type": "perf", "section": "‚ö° Performance Improvements" },
    { "type": "refactor", "section": "‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring" },
    { "type": "docs", "section": "üìù Documentation" },
    { "type": "style", "section": "üíÑ Style", "hidden": true },
    { "type": "test", "section": "‚úÖ Tests", "hidden": true },
    { "type": "build", "section": "üì¶ Build System", "hidden": true },
    { "type": "ci", "section": "üîß CI", "hidden": true },
    { "type": "chore", "section": "üî® Chores", "hidden": true },
    { "type": "revert", "section": "‚è™ Reverts" },
  ],
  "bumpFiles": ["package.json"], // Files whose version field will be updated
}
```

Explanation of the main fields:

| Field                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `releaseCommitMessageFormat` | Enforces a predictable commit message (`chore(release): vX.Y.Z`).                                                                                  |
| `tagPrefix`                  | Tags are generated as `v1.2.3` instead of bare `1.2.3`.                                                                                            |
| `types`                      | Groups Conventional Commit types into friendly changelog sections. Less interesting types are marked `hidden` so they never clutter the changelog. |
| `bumpFiles`                  | Which files receive the new version string. Here we only touch `package.json` (the lockfile is content-addressed by PNPM).                         |

With this configuration you get a clean, emoji-labelled changelog and a fully automated semantic version bump every time you run `pnpm release`.

## Git Flow

We keep the workflow intentionally minimal:

1. **Branches**
   ‚Ä¢ `master` (or `main`) ‚Äì always releasable  
   ‚Ä¢ short-lived feature / fix branches (prefix with your initials if desired)

2. **Feature work**
   - Branch from `master`.
   - Commit using Conventional Commits.
   - Open a PR; squash & merge once approved.

3. **Releases**
   - Only from an up-to-date `master`.
   - Never commit directly to tagged releases; use normal commits and rerun `pnpm release` if needed.

4. **Hotfixes**
   - Branch from the tagged commit, fix, release, merge back.

## Best Practices Checklist

- Commits:
  - Use the correct **type**/**scope** and imperative mood.
  - Keep subjects ‚â§ 72 chars; wrap body at 100 chars.
- Pull Requests:
  - Keep them focused; squash merge to maintain linear history.
  - Ensure CI is green before merging.
- Releases:
  - Always run `pnpm release -- --dry-run` first.
  - Push with `--follow-tags` so CI picks up the tag.
- Tags:
  - Never edit or delete tags after publishing; create a new patch version instead.

Happy coding!
