# 🧱 Layered Architecture

A structured approach separating **Core** and **Framework** responsibilities for scalable, production-ready applications.

---

## 🧩 Core Layer

> **Purpose:** Provide cross-cutting concerns reusable across services and modules.

- Logging, configuration, and error handling
- Validation, constants, helpers, and utilities

---

## ⚙️ Framework Layer

> **Purpose:** Framework-specific integration — here, targeting **Express.js** for conventional setup.

- Environment management and bootstrapping logic
- Ready-to-use MVC/MVP scaffolding
- Dependency injection and lifecycle handling
- Routing conventions, middleware, and interceptors
- Exception filters, response builders, and DI container
- Production-grade configurations (CORS, security, etc.)
